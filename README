Final Project from my "MATH596: Mathematical Data Science" class.
I worked on this project with my classmate KONNOR PAYNE.
Our project consisted of finding a dataset where we could demonstrate what we had learned from the class.
We found the "credit card fraud" dataset on Kaggle.com from the author NIDULA ELGIRIYEWITHANA.
We uploaded the dataset, analyzed the multiple parameters, 
and created linear regression models to predict credit card fraud with varying degrees of accuracy and negativity bias.
We give credit for the PCA code to OLUWAFEMI OYEDEJI. 

This project was revised on 9/25/24 to fix critical errors with how the notebook and Python file interacted with each other.
This was ultimately solved through global variable declaration inside credit_card_fraud.py
along with a `setup()` function to call inside the notebook
